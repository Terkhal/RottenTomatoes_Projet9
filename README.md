# RottenTomatoes_project9

Or Boosted_Potatoes for me, is a reproduction of the review website "rottentomatoes"
Group project / 5 days
Being able to fetch from the API TMDB (The Movie DataBase), and populate our own api with the selected movie.
rate and reviews them.

Back-end: Express / Front-end: NextJS / MongoDB

## My_work
This time, I focused on the front-end for a change, I prepared most of my components based on the final object they would receive so i wouldn't have to redo everything once the API was getting prepared by a teammate.

I worked on the index display, the favorite movie selection and the conditionnal rendering whether the using had selected some movie as favorite, was connected etc...
